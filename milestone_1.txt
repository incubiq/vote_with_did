  M1 - Finalise all specifications
========================================================================================

OUTPUTS

We will use the first milestone to finalise the specifications. The outputs are:

 - Assessing the Identus/Agent node system for managing DID and VCs
 - Reviewing choices, validating capabilities, and defining minimal requirements (functional and nonfunctional) for a DID wallet as a browser extension 
 - Defining all requirements (functional and nonfunctional) for a minimal Voting App, including for those roles: Admin, Designer, Voter, Viewer
 - Reviewing choices for a voting App (App vs DApp) and establishing final choice
 - Defining high level architecture for the chosen Voting App choice (App vs DApp), including what will be delivered as smart contract, and what will be delivered as more classic "Web2"

Each of those outputs will be documented (with documentation and/or video) in the GitHub repo (https://github.com/incubiq/vote_with_did). 


ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
 - We have proof that Identus is fit for purpose for the DID/VC part
 - We have clarity on the requirements for a DID wallet as a browser extension, and proof that it can be done 
 - We have clarity of requirements, and high level design for the voting App/DApp
 - All requirements and specifications are uploaded to GitHub
 - There is no major blocking point to deliver the full solution

Note that the goal is to deliver a DApp but pending on further evaluations during this milestone, it could be a valid solution to limit the DApp to a small set of smart contracts and build the rest as a Web2 backend SaaS/Cloud app.

EVIDENCE OF COMPLETION

GitHub (https://github.com/incubiq/vote_with_did) is updated with those output deliveries:

 - for Identus: 
  * a video proof assessing capabilities,
  * a Postman test collection for testing Identus
 - for DID wallet as a browser extension: 
  * a video explaining review of wallet choices, 
  * a requirement document 
 - for a minimal voting app: 
  * a video explaining review of requirements, 
  * a requirement document, 
  * a high level architecture document establishing Web3 vs Web3 components and how they connect together.
