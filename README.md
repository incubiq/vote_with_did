# Reinventing Voting with Digital Identity, Trust and Anonymity

## Introduction

Current voting apps in the Cardano ecosystem lack Decentralized Identity. By storing data centrally, they put user privacy at risk, and can be exposed to fraud, manipulation, hacks, or data leaks.

Using Atala Prism on Cardano, we will offer an open-source SDK and an App to deliver secure and anonymous voting across the whole Cardano eco-system, replacing private legacy voting apps.

This project is planned to start in August 2024, and be delivered by end July 2025.
